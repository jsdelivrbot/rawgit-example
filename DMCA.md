# RawGit DMCA Notice & Takedown Procedure

RawGit abides by the federal [Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(DMCA)](http://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf) by responding to notices
of alleged infringement that comply with the DMCA and other applicable laws. As
part of our response, we may disable access to material that is claimed to be
infringing, in which case we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner
of the GitHub account associated with the affected material so that they may
make a counter notification.

RawGit is a service that proxies requests to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
RawGit does not control content hosted on GitHub and cannot remove content from
GitHub that it does not own or control. If you are the copyright owner of
content hosted on GitHub and you have not authorized the use of your content,
please contact GitHub or the owner of the associated GitHub account directly to
have the content removed.

Before serving either a Notice of Infringing Material or a Counter-Notification,
you may wish to contact a lawyer to better understand your rights and
obligations under the DMCA and other applicable laws. The following notice
requirements are intended to comply with RawGit's rights and obligations under
the DMCA and, in particular, section 512(c), and do not constitute legal advice.

## Notice of Infringing Material

To file a notice of infringing material, please provide a notification
containing the following details:

1.  Reasonably sufficient details to enable us to identify the work claimed to
    be infringed or, if multiple works are claimed to be infringed, a
    representative list of such works (for example: title, author, any
    registration or tracking number, URL);

2.  Reasonably sufficient detail to enable us to identify and locate the
    material that is claimed to be infringing (for example a link to the URL
    that contains the material);

3.  Your contact information so that we can contact you (for example, your
    address, telephone number, email address);

4.  A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material
    identified in (2) is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or
    the law;

5.  A statement, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the
    notification is accurate and that you are authorized to act on behalf of the
    owner of the exclusive right that is alleged to be infringed.

6.  Your physical or electronic signature.

## Counter-Notification

If material that you have posted to GitHub and served via RawGit has been taken
down, you may file a counter-notification that contains the following details:

1.  Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has
    been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was
    removed or disabled;

2.  A statement, under penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief
    that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or
    misidentification of the material in question;

3.  Your name, address and telephone number;

4.  A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District
    Court for judicial district in which your address is located or, if your
    address is outside of the USA, for any judicial district in which RawGit may
    be found and that you will accept service of process from the person who
    submitted a notice in compliance with the section (c)(1)(C) of the DMCA, as
    generally described above;

5.  Your physical or electronic signature.
